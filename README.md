# SimpleAPIWithGo
This is an simple API project using ECHO framework

the project has three main components, two of them are APIs an the other is a Client for comsuming the APIs.

The first component called API (pure golang) is, as it's name indicates, an API coded by only Golang pure code but it does not have an optimal routing system.
Other component called API2 (ECHO framework) was build using ECHO framework to improve the past API and implement an optimal router system.
finally, I coded a client for making trails.

Soon I will create and upload a new API project more complete and complex for improve my skills.
